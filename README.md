# Network_Building
Cosmos Hub that implements staking based around incentives for network building. I am new to Git and Go and Blockchain coding, but have done a lot of fractal stuff. The idea is clear, and can be put to code already, but linking it all into the Cosmos system will require lots of learning. For now I am practicing with basics until an initial chain is running. Anyone who wants to join and help is welcome but to start you would have to tutor me on basics, once that is complete I would code the main idea, then the process would go on towards refinements and adjustments.
